# Best Practices

This page contains general pieces of advice which do not strictly belong to the [Specification Explained](specification.md) chapter because they are not directly tied to the OpenAPI Specification.

However, they greatly simplify creating and maintaining OpenAPI documents, so they are worth keeping in mind.

## Keeping a Single Source of Truth

<!--
Always keep a single source of truth, no matter your workflow (Design-first, Code-first , ...).
-->

## How to Write an OpenAPI Document

<!--
By hand, with editors, with Domain-Specific Languages, with Code annotations.
Hand-written will probably be more efficient (like moving common parts to a higher level). Normally, it's a mix.
For reference: https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/theres-no-reason-to-write-openapi-by-hand/.
-->

## Working with Big Documents

<!--
Do not Repeat Yourself: reusing descriptions using `$ref`.
Example directory structures.
Use `tags`.
